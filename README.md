After setting up the IoT device, implementing the web interface that will
display and allow the user to interact with the sensor data. The app was developed using
the component-based architecture of React and utilized various open-source packages
available on npm.

The web app communicates with the IoT device through a backend server, which
receives data from the sensors and sends it to the app in response to requests made by
the user. The communication between the web app and the backend server is typically
achieved using RESTful APIs or WebSockets.
To display the sensor data, React components are used to create interactive and dynamic
user interfaces. Data visualization libraries like Chart.js or D3.js can be leveraged to
render graphs and charts that provide graphical representations of the sensor readings.
These libraries enable the web app to present the data in a visually appealing and
understandable manner.
The React web app implementation focuses on providing a seamless user experience by
handling user interactions and updating the UI in response to real-time data changes.
React's virtual DOM and state management libraries like Redux or React Context can be
utilized to efficiently update and re-render the UI components as new data arrives.
Overall, the implementation of the React web app complements the IoT device setup by
providing users with a user-friendly interface to monitor and interact with the sensor
data. The app leverages React's component-based architecture and various packages
from the React ecosystem to create an efficient and responsive user interface.
